- [ ] Implement server-side pagination and sort whitelisting for Spese and Entrate endpoints

- [ ] Implement filtering parameters for recurring operations API and use in frontend/mobile
- [ ] Remove or implement `next-occurrences` endpoints currently unused
- [ ] Align mobile API calls with backend (single consolidated endpoint) and handle pagination metadata
